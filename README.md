# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

This project involves analyzing crowdfunding data to help a playwright who wants to use crowdfunding to fund her next play.

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the results of crowdfunding campaigns with respect to when the campaigns were launched and how successful those campaigns were in reaching their donation goals. The data used for this analysis is available on the “Kickstarter” tab in the Kickstarter_Challenge workbook located [here](https://github.com/mshideler/Kickstarter-Analysis).

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

This analysis involved creating a pivot table to display the number of successful outcomes, failed outcomes and canceled outcomes in relation to the month/year the campaign was launched.  This table is in the Kickstarter_Challenge workbook on the tab named “Theater Outcomes by Launch Date.”  Here, the data show the outcomes of theater campaigns per each month of the year in both tabular and graphical formats.  Using the filters for parent category (type of campaign) and years, one can see all campaign outcomes per month for any or all given years.  The picture below shows theater outcomes based on their launch date.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

This analysis involved determining the percentage of successful, failed and canceled campaigns for plays per each goal range (for example, for goal amounts less than $1,000 or for goal amounts ranging from $20,000 to $24,999).  This table is also in the Kickstarter_Challenge workbook on the tab named “Outcomes Based on Goals.”  To get the percentage of each campaign outcome, it was necessary to count how many of each outcome fell in each range.  This was done using the COUNTIFS Excel formula and specifying what data to use and what criteria to use.  Summing the outcomes per range results in the number of total projects per range.  The percentage of an outcome per range is simply calculated by dividing quantity of a specific outcome by the total number of projects for a given goal range.  Charting the resulting data produces the below picture.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

The one thing that challenged me in the Outcome Based on Launch Date analysis was figuring out how to list the months for each year to see the corresponding number of outcomes.  I Initially tried using Google but felt none of the results helped me.  I then noticed three fields under “Rows” in the pivot table and removed two of them to see what would happen.  By removing “Years” and “Quarters,” which were automatically generated by adding the field “Date Created Conversion”, I got the result I needed.

I experienced two challenges for the Outcomes Based on Goals analysis.  The first, specifying ranges as criteria in the COUNTIFS formula, was easily remedied by watching the video in the boot camp spot.  The second was in confirming the number of canceled outcomes for plays is zero across all ranges, which again was done easily by filtering the “Subcategory” column for plays only and then attempting to filter the “Outcomes” column for canceled; however, “canceled” wasn’t available to filter, which told me it’s because there are no canceled outcomes for plays.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

  One conclusion that can be drawn about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date is Spring appears to be the ideal time to launch theater campaigns given the spike that occurs from March to May.

  A second conclusion that can be drawn about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date is December is a bad month to launch theater campaigns because number of successful campaigns nearly equals the number of failed campaigns during that month.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

  One conclusion that can be drawn about the Outcomes based on Goals is goals less than $1,000 are the most successful.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

  One limitation of this dataset is that it’s limited to plays and not the entire theater category, which includes musical plays and spaces.  Another limitation is plays with a goal of $50,000 aren’t included.  It is unknown if this was done on purpose or if this is just an error.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
  One possible table/graph we can create is one that looks at the average length of a campaign depending on the outcome to see if there is a correlation.  Another possible one we can create is the number of successful campaigns per subcategory of theater and perhaps filter by country.
